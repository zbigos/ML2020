## Problem 7
Assume we have two classes C <sub>1 </sub> and C <sub>2 </sub> with 50 elements each.
Leave one out will pick an element from some class (let's call it C<sub>X </sub>). In this case, the training dataset would contain 49 elements of class C<sub>X</sub> and 50 of C<sub>Y </sub> thus classifying the element to class Y (the wrong answer).
Thus this leave one out validation will have a 0% fitness score.

## Problem 9
Problems with:  
 -   **up-down vote score**  
 -   **mean** Having 1000 upvotes and 1 downvote is worse than having just 1 upvote.  
 -   **lower or upper confidence bound of the score**

## Problem 10
TL;DR there is an election between Ladon and Roosevelt. There is an organisation that predicts Ladon getting 53% of the votes (Roosevelt 47%). Said organisation is famous for being right.  

Those numbers were taken from a poll, that would question 2M4 people, a sampling rate of ~20%. The questionning was done as follows. They have taken a list of people from magazine subscription, club memberships and telephone book. Those 10M people were mailed mock voting ballots and were to send them back.  

The first problem was that those 10M people were taken from lists that could have been biased. A stathistical person probably does not belong to a club nor do they subscribe to a magazine.  
The second problem could be the fact that only 25% of ballots were sent back in, meaning that some people were not interesed in the poll (but were interested in voting).

Actual results were 62% for Roosevelt, 38% Ladon
